  - Implemented a form to add new contacts.
  - Displayed a list of contacts.
  - Included a search box for filtering contacts by name.

- **Component Structure**:

  - Each component was organized in its own folder within `src/components`.
  - Default exports were used for all components.

- **Initial Contacts**:

  - Predefined contacts were hardcoded for development and testing purposes.
